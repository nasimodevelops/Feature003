                    <p class="post-excerpt is-size-5">irl is composed of Colton Watkins and Henry Ham from rural Kentucky. </p>
                    <p class="post-excerpt">
                        "We have known each other since elementary school, and started making music together in 2019. 
                        Since then we played with the idea of being in a band and started writing songs for fun. 
                        The very first idea for a band we had was a genreless comedy group inspired by bands like Ninja Sex Party 
                        and Flight of the Conchords. In a fit of tired inspiration one summer night, Colton wrote the framework for 
                        the song “Streetlights.” After getting it stuck in our heads several times, we decided it would be a good first 
                        song to record. Soon after, we decided on the name irl and continued to write songs under this name."</p>

                  <p class="post-excerpt">We will have an EP out by the end of this year that will 
                      be available on Spotify, Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Youtube. Our inspirations 
                      are far-reaching and wide, and we think it comes out in our music. We both grew 
                      up on classic rock and still occasionally listen to the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Toto. 
                      Other influences include Her’s, Mitski, Penelope Scott, Bowling Shoes, Cavetown, Snail Mail, 
                      Beach Bunny, and Sidney Gish.

                  <h1 class="title post-title">Genre of Music</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">Our genre is sort of whatever kind of music we feel 
                      like making at the time, but generally say it is alternative pop/indie pop 
                      if we are made to pick one. We have songs ranging from dream pop to jazz to 
                      acoustic in addition to a more traditional indie pop sound. 
                    Henry and Colton both play all the instruments in the band and both sing. </p>
